## 🔧 Development

### Project Structure
The project follows a clean architecture pattern with clear separation of concerns:

- **Models**: Data structures and business logic
- **Services**: Business logic and external integrations
- **Repositories**: Data access layer
- **ViewModels**: UI logic and state management
- **Views**: SwiftUI user interface components

### Key Patterns
- **MVVM**: Model-View-ViewModel architecture
- **Repository Pattern**: Abstracted data access
- **Dependency Injection**: Service injection for testability
- **Protocol-Oriented Programming**: Interface-based design


## 🎨 Customization

### Themes
The app uses a consistent pixel art theme with:
- Custom pixel fonts (Micro5)
- Pixel-style UI components
- Retro color schemes
- Custom button and background modifiers

### Drawing Tools
The drawing canvas supports:
- Multiple grid sizes (16x16, 32x32, 33x33, etc.)
- Custom color palettes
- Various drawing operations
- Real-time collaboration features

## ☁️ Backend Services

### Cloud Functions
The application includes automated Cloud Functions for competition management:

- **Competition Scheduling**: Automated 24-hour competition cycles
- **Status Transitions**: Automatic progression from active → scoring → past
- **Like Rights Management**: Automated distribution of voting rights
- **Artwork Archiving**: Automatic cleanup and archiving of competition entries

### Competition Lifecycle Automation
```javascript
// Automated competition management
const checkCompetitionsSchedule = onSchedule({
  schedule: "every 24 hours",
  timeZone: "Europe/Amsterdam",
  region: "europe-west3"
}, async () => {
  // Handle competition status transitions
  // Manage voting rights distribution
  // Archive completed competitions
});
```
